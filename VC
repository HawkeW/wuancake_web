<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bills-Sydney-Food-Bill-Granger/dp/0864119917/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1447677528&sr=8-1&keywords=Sydney+food"><cite>Sydney Food</cite>
</a>by Bill Grainger.Ever since tasting
these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup>visit to Bill's resterant in Kings Cross ,Sydney ,I have been after the recipe.
I have since transformed it into what I really belive are the <em>best</em>scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>
<p>This recipe is what I call a <q>very special breakfast</q>;just look in the ingredient to see why. It has to be
tasted.</p>
